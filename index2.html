					<h1>THE DREAM IS REAL</h1>

						<p>Dominick "Dom" Cobb and Arthur are "extractors", who perform corporate espionage using 
an experimental military technology to infiltrate the subconscious of their targets and extract 
valuable information through a shared dream world. Their latest target, Japanese businessman 
Saito, reveals that he arranged their mission himself to test Cobb for a seemingly impossible job: 
planting an idea in a person's subconscious, or "inception". To break up the energy conglomerate
 of ailing competitor Maurice Fischer, Saito wants Cobb to convince Fischer's son and heir, Robert,
 to dissolve his father's company. In return, Saito promises to use his influence to clear Cobb of a
 murder charge, allowing Cobb to return home to his children. Cobb accepts the offer and assembles
 his team: Eames, a conman and identity forger; Yusuf, a chemist who concocts a powerful sedative
 for a stable "dream within a dream" strategy; and Ariadne, an architecture student tasked with
 designing the labyrinth of the dream landscapes, recruited with the help of Cobb's father-in-law, 
Professor Stephen Miles. While dream-sharing with Cobb, Ariadne learns his subconscious 
houses an invasive projection of his late wife Mal.


When the elder Fischer dies in Sydney, Robert Fischer accompanies the body on a ten-hour flight 
back to Los Angeles, which the team (including Saito, who wants to verify their success) uses as an 
opportunity to sedate and take Fischer into a shared dream. At each dream level, the person
 generating the dream stays behind to set up a "kick" that will be used to awaken the other
 sleeping team members from the deeper dream level; to be successful, these kicks must occur 
simultaneously at each dream level, a fact complicated due to the nature of time which proceeds 
much faster in each successive level. The first level is Yusuf's dream of a rainy Los Angeles. The team 
abducts Fischer, but they are attacked by armed projections from Fischer's subconscious, which has 
been trained to defend against extraction. The team takes Fischer and a wounded Saito to a warehouse, 
where Cobb reveals that while dying in the dream would normally wake Saito up, the powerful sedatives 
needed to stabilize the multi-level dream will instead send a dying dreamer into "limbo", a world of infinite
 subconscious from which escape is difficult and a dreamer risks forgetting they are in a dream. Despite
 these setbacks, the team continues with the mission.
